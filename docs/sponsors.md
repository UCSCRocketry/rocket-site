# Sponsors

We extend our deepest gratitude to our sponsors for their generous support.
Their contributions enable us to innovate, build, and push the boundaries of
rocketry and engineering excellence. Without their support, our projects and
competitions would not be possible.

The resources provided by our sponsors help fund critical components,
manufacturing, and research efforts, ensuring that we continue to excel in
aerospace engineering and competition environments.
