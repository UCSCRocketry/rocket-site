<h2>WE ARE UCSC'S PREMIER AEROSPACE ORGANIZATION</h2>

<p>
Nested within the forests, the UCSC Rocket Team is the leading aerospace
organization at the University of California, Santa Cruz. We design and build
high-powered rockets that push bounds of performance while performing research
missions.

We are dedicated to providing our students with a unique hands-on experience
that spans a variety of disciplines such as Computer Science, Robotics
Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Astrophysics, as well as Business
Administration and the Arts. Rocket Team is welcoming to any student enrolled at
UC Santa Cruz.

<h2>PUSHING LIMITS</h2>
<p>
We don’t settle for what’s already been done. Every project challenges us to design smarter, build stronger, and fly higher. From first concepts to full-scale launches, we test the boundaries of what student engineers can achieve. Each step forward brings us closer to new milestones in rocketry, and prepares us to take on the challenges of tomorrow’s aerospace industry.

<h2>EMPOWERING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY</h2>

<p>
Beyond engineering excellence, we’re dedicated to sharing our passion for aerospace with our community. Through outreach events, workshops, and demonstrations, we inspire future innovators and provide students of all backgrounds with hands-on opportunities to explore STEM. By building together, we strengthen not only our team, but the community that supports us.
