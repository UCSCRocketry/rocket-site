## WE ARE UCSC'S PREMIER AEROSPACE ORGANIZATION

Nested within the forests, the UCSC Rocket Team is the leading aerospace
organization at the University of California, Santa Cruz. We design and build
high-powered rockets that push bounds of performance while performing research
missions.

We are dedicated to providing our students with a unique hands-on experience
that spans a variety of disciplines such as Computer Science, Robotics
Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Astrophysics, as well as Business
Administration and the Arts. Rocket Team is welcoming to any student enrolled at
UC Santa Cruz.

## PUSHING LIMITS

As the home of aerospace engineering at UCSC, the UCSC Rocket Team pushes the
bounds of our school. From competing in the most prestigious rocketry
competitions to researching groundbreaking thrust-vectoring designs, our team is
the embodiment of success in the midst of challenges.

## EMPOWERING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY

Not only do we love rocketry, but we share our love with the wider community.
From visits to grade schools, to partnerships with local companies, we're deeply
embedded within our community.
