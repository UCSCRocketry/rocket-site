# Vehicle

The Vehicle Systems Team leads the design, manufacturing, and testing of the
main launch vehicle, including critical components like the airframe, fins, and
propulsion system. Our team prioritizes structural integrity, propulsion
efficiency, and overall flight readiness throughout each stage of the design and
building process.

Clear and consistent communication with other teams is essential to the smooth
integration of subsystems within the final launch vehicle. We prioritize the
safe housing and deployment of the Payload while accommodating space and
functionality for student-developed avionics, ensuring a successful performance
during the competition flight. Recovery

## Recovery

The Recovery Subteam is a specialized branch of the Vehicle Team focused on
designing, testing, and implementing systems to ensure the safe return of rocket
components post-flight. Our primary objective is to minimize damage during
descent and landing, enabling the reuse of critical components and enhancing
overall mission sustainability.
