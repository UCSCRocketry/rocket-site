# Avionics

## Electrical

The electrical subteam develops compact and performant hardware that is designed
to serve a variety of tasks on the rocket. Numerous sensors to collect data,
storage to log it, high powered radios to transmit it to the ground.

## Software

Our software flies onboard the rocket to collect, process, log, and transmit
data. Using advanced sensor fusion algorithms we can enhance the data collected
and extrapolate higher resolution data.

## Ground Control

Visualizing data and controlling some aspects of the flight from the ground
allows us to understand flight data in real time. 3D web rendering techniques
give us the ability to analyze flight patterns.
