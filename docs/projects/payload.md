# Payload

Payload is the intersection of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering.
Each year our payload team takes on a new mission to advance the scientific
capabilities of our rocket. Experimenting with active stabilization, novel data
collection methods, and more, payload isn't new to researching how ideas behave
in real world environments.
