# Project Subteams

The UCSC Rocket Team has a rich history competing in rocketry competitions since
it's founding in 2017. The team has previously competed in the NASA USLI
competition, where it has placed high and even won awards for outstanding design
and sportsmanship in 2018, 2019, and 2021.

Beginning in 2024, the team has taken the step up to the International Rocketry
Engineering Challenge, formerly known as Spaceport America. Over 150 teams
compete annually in what is widely considered one of the largest and most
prestigious competitions in the world. Learn more about the International
Rocketry Engineering Competition.

## Getting Involved

You can get involved with one of three project subteams, each focusing on a
different aspect of the rocket:

1. [Vehicle](vehicle.md)
    - Responsible for the design, manufacturing, and testing process of the rocket
    while also safely carrying the payload.
2. [Payload](payload.md)
    - Focuses more on the equipment that the rocket carries inside by designing
    and experimenting with the technology being tested in flight.
3. [Avionics](avionics.md)
    - In charge of making sure the rocket knows where it is and can send data back
    to the team by building the electronics and developing the software needed to
    process data.

Each subteam offers hands-on projects that contribute to the overall state and progress
of the rocket. Whether your interest lies in electronic, software, or mechanical
engineering, you have a place in the team. We look forward to working with you.
