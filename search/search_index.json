We design and       build high-powered rockets that push bounds of performance while       performing research missions.            Rocket Team is home to a unique experience       that enables students of any background of major to take on the biggest       problems facing the modern areospace industry and academia. We understand       that ingenuity can come from anywhere, and take us everywhere, so we       embrace curiosity and persevere to build our spirit and build tomorrow.     </p>        Your browser does not support the video tag.      PUSHING LIMITS <p>       \"Settle\" isn't in our vocabulary. \"Good enough\" isn't good enough for us.       The only competitor we have is ourselves, and we're dead set on winning.       With every new project we break boundries, pushing ourselves higher and       higher, soaring to new hights in search of something greater than       ourselves. Our members take this attitude with them wherever they go,       working tirelssly to advance the aerospace industry, and show the world       all a slug is capable of.     </p> EMPOWERING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY <p>       Beyond engineering excellence, we\u2019re dedicated to sharing our passion for       aerospace with our community. Through outreach events, workshops, and       demonstrations, we inspire future innovators and provide students of all       backgrounds with hands-on opportunities to explore STEM. By building       together, we strengthen not only our team, but the community that supports       us.     </p>"},{"location":"404/","title":"404","text":""},{"location":"sponsors/","title":"Sponsors","text":"<p>The UC Santa Cruz Rocket Team extends our deepest gratitude to our sponsors for their support.
